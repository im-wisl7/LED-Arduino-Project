# LED Control with Arduino

## Description
This is my first Arduino project where I designed and implemented a basic circuit to control an LED using a breadboard. The project demonstrates practical skills in Arduino programming, circuit design, and electronics fundamentals.

## Features
- Turn LED on and off using Arduino code
- Hands-on experience with digital output and breadboard connections
- Learning how to translate theoretical concepts into a working project

## Skills Gained
- Arduino programming
- Breadboard usage
- Circuit design
- Basic electronics
